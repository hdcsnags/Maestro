# Part 1 — Stable Architecture

*Updated only when the system structurally changes. Not session-volatile.*

## What Maestro Is

Maestro is a multi-agent AI orchestration console. A user (the "Conductor") broadcasts a prompt to multiple AI agents across providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter), reviews their competing responses side-by-side, synthesizes the best ideas, and — in build mode — commits real code to GitHub through scoped, lane-assigned agents.

It exists because no tool lets one person direct an entire AI orchestra from ideation through secure code delivery.

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Edge Functions in Deno)
- **Providers**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter (BYOK via encrypted_secrets)
- **GitHub**: GitHub App "MaestroThamos" (OAuth user-to-server tokens)

## Build Phases

`analysis → design → pre_build → build → bouncer → complete`

## Database (19 active tables)

Core: workspaces, agents, sessions, rounds, responses, syntheses
GitHub: repo_connections, execution_runs, approval_requests
Security: provider_connections, encrypted_secrets, audit_events
Sprint B: design_artifacts, build_lanes, bouncer_events, build_reports, concierge_decisions
Legacy (unused): agent_skills, flags

## Agent Roster

15 agents: 5 provider groups × 3 slots. Only slot-0 active by default.

**Source of truth for model names: `src/types/index.ts`** — if what's listed below disagrees with that file, the file wins.

| Provider | Slot 0 | Slot 1 | Slot 2 |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| anthropic | Haiku 4.5 | Sonnet 4.6 | Opus 4.6 |
| openai | GPT-5.4 Mini | GPT-5.4 Builder | GPT-5.4 (Reasoning) |
| google | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| openrouter_a | GPT-OSS 20B (free) | Gemma 4 31B (free) | Llama 4 Maverick |
| openrouter_b | Sonnet 4.6 (OR) | GPT-5.4 Builder (OR) | Kimi K2 |

**Last verified against `src/types/index.ts`**: 2026-04-12

## Non-Obvious Decisions (the "why" archive)

- **GitHub App, not OAuth App**: Maestro is registered as GitHub App "MaestroThamos". `X-OAuth-Scopes` header is always empty — permissions come from the App installation manifest, not OAuth scopes. Never check for `repo` scope.
- **Single token**: One GitHub token per user (stored in `encrypted_secrets` where `provider='github'`). It's a user-to-server token. github-repos, github-execute, and github-create-repo all use it.
- **ARCHITECT.md never committed via github-execute**: The edge function blocks writes to ARCHITECT.md. It's generated and stored in `sessions.architect_md` only.
- **Truncation guard**: github-execute rejects file content containing `// ... existing code` patterns. Catches LLM laziness but can false-positive on legitimate comments — known tradeoff, accepted.
- **Build spec locking**: `sessions.build_spec_locked` must be true before build phase. github-execute checks server-side. Prevents mid-build spec mutations.
- **Lane scope is authoritative in build mode**: `build_lanes.lane_paths` determines what files an agent can write, not `agents.scoped_paths`. Lanes are populated from Architect.md parsing.

## Patterns & Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode is on** — `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enforced. Dead code will fail the build.
- **All shared types go in `src/types/index.ts` only** — never inline interfaces in components.
- **Use `.maybeSingle()` not `.single()`** for Supabase queries — `.single()` throws on zero rows.
- **Component internal ordering**: state declarations → useEffect hooks → handler functions → JSX return.
- **`audit_events` is append-only** — never UPDATE or DELETE rows. RLS enforces this.
- **Custom CSS classes for the carousel live in `index.css`** — do not replicate carousel animations with Tailwind utilities.

# Part 2 — Operational State

*Updated every session. Every claim here MUST have a verification date or be marked `unverified`.*

## What's Working

## What's Broken or Incomplete

| Issue | Since | Owner |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Build broadcast → Execute flow untested end-to-end | 2026-04-12 | Unassigned |
| Council auth fixes landed but still need live smoke test after `supabase.functions.invoke` migration | 2026-04-12 | Unassigned |
| No real-time streaming — responses arrive all at once; StreamingFolio is visual-only | Pre-existing | — |
| Concierge auto-trigger after build broadcast may double-fire | Pre-existing | — |
| github-create-repo: no in-app guidance when Administration:write is missing | 2026-04-12 | — |
| GitHub App install UX still manual — backend capability exists, in-app detection/prompt does not | Pre-existing | — |
| No markdown rendering in FolioCard response content | Pre-existing | — |
| No merge strategy for synthesized execution (last write wins on path collisions) | Pre-existing | — |
| Legacy tables (agent_skills, flags) still in schema but unused | Pre-existing | — |

## Known Drift Risks

These areas change often and should be re-verified after any significant work session:

- **Model roster** — check `src/types/index.ts` against the Agent Roster table in Part 1
- **Deployed function status** — `supabase functions list` vs the Edge Functions table
- **Migration status** — check for unapplied migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- **Frontend bundle status** — does `npm run build` pass clean?

## Next Logical Steps

1. Smoke test the full Build flow: Pre-Build lock → Build broadcast → review responses → Execute Build → verify files written to GitHub
2. If patches reach github-execute correctly, test bouncer gate after build completes
3. Add GitHub App install detection (`/user/installations`) so UI can prompt users who authorized but haven't installed

# Part 3 — Session Log

*Append-only, newest first. Never delete entries.*

### 2026-04-12 — Claude Code (Opus 4.6)

**What was done**: Wired patches into BuildWorkspace.tsx handleExecute so Execute Build sends approved agent responses as patches[] to github-execute. Previously the frontend never sent patches, causing a NO_PATCHES 400 every time.

**Files touched**: `src/components/reveal/BuildWorkspace.tsx`

**Decisions made**:
- Patches assembled from `buildResponses` filtered by `approvedResponseIds` — approval UI already existed, but the mapping to `AgentPatch` shape and POST body inclusion was missing.
- `scoped_paths` come from `lanes` table (matched by agent_name), not from the agent record — lanes are authoritative scope in build phase.
- `commit_message` defaults to `"${agent_name}: build patch"` — no user input yet.

**What didn't work**: N/A — single edit landed clean.

---

### 2026-04-12 — OpenAI Codex

**What was done**: Verified remote operational status for the shared docs. Confirmed 14 active edge functions via `supabase functions list` and confirmed exactly one unapplied migration via `supabase migration list`.

**Files touched**: `MAESTRO_STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`

**Decisions made**:
- Promoted migration status from placeholder to verified fact because the remote project was directly queryable.
- Kept unresolved runtime paths marked as untested instead of upgrading them to "working" from deploy status alone.
- Relaxed one `AGENTS.md` duplication rule so `MAESTRO_STATE.md` can continue serving web-agent cold-start needs.

**What didn't work**: N/A — remote CLI checks returned cleanly.

---

### 2026-04-12 — OpenAI Codex

**What was done**: Orb state machine implementation completed and committed. Added `deriveOrbState()` in `src/lib/orbState.ts`, refactored `EmptyStage.tsx` into a pure renderer, and wired the derived orb state through `WorkspacePage.tsx`.

**Files touched**: `src/lib/orbState.ts`, `src/components/reveal/EmptyStage.tsx`, `src/pages/WorkspacePage.tsx`, `src/context/MaestroContext.tsx`

**What didn't work**: N/A — `npm run typecheck` passed after implementation. Committed as `4fb823c Add derived orb state machine`.

---

### 2026-04-12 — OpenAI Codex

**What was done**: Replaced manual edge-function auth headers in `useOrchestration.ts` with `supabase.functions.invoke(...)` for `orchestrate`, `concierge-triage`, `concierge`, and `synthesize`. This followed a prior fix that removed anon-key fallback / invalid JWT behavior.

**Files touched**: `src/hooks/useOrchestration.ts`

**Decisions made**:
- Stopped hand-rolling `Authorization` headers for council calls and let the Supabase client carry auth context.
- Kept `ensureSession()` as the gate before authenticated orchestration calls.
- Left runtime verification open because the code path is fixed but not yet smoked end-to-end.

**What didn't work**: Initial auth fix still left too much manual header logic; second pass moved the path to `functions.invoke(...)`.

---

### 2026-04-10 — OpenAI Codex

**What was done**: Hardened build artifact parsing and validation. Added provider-aware output budgets, manifest validation metadata, builder execution filtering, and promoted GPT-5.4 to the explicit OpenAI builder lane.

**Files touched**: `supabase/functions/orchestrate/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/github-execute/index.ts`, `src/hooks/useOrchestration.ts`, `src/components/reveal/BuildWorkspace.tsx`, `src/types/index.ts`, `supabase/migrations/20260410143000_promote_gpt54_builder.sql`

**Decisions made**:
- Kept `file_manifest` as the compatibility layer, but added `artifact_protocol`, `complete`, `continuation_prompt`, and `manifest_errors`.
- Blocked incomplete or invalid manifests in the review UI before GitHub execution.
- Renamed the GPT-5.4 premium lane to explicit builder language so the docs and UI match the intended pairing with Sonnet.

**What didn't work**: Runtime smoke test of the full build path still pending.

---

### 2026-04-10 — OpenAI Codex

**What was done**: Stabilized design artifact previews. Standard design mode now uses GPT-5.4 for Visual Lead and Claude Sonnet 4.6 for Structure Lead; frontend and edge parsing now recover HTML from fenced/nested JSON safely.

**Files touched**: `src/components/reveal/DesignPhase.tsx`, `supabase/functions/design/index.ts`, `src/types/index.ts`

**Decisions made**:
- Increased design output budgets.
- Cleaned `html_content` at both ingestion and render time.
- Expanded the preview UI so the standard two-designer flow is actually usable.

**What didn't work**: N/A — local validation passed; backend deploy was completed for `design` parsing changes earlier in the same effort.

## Open Questions

- Should github-create-repo show a better error when Administration:write permission is missing?
- Is the build broadcast prompt (currently hardcoded in BuildWorkspace) good enough, or should it come from the concierge `pre_build_complete` output?
- Do we need a re-broadcast mechanism if agent responses have no file_manifest?
